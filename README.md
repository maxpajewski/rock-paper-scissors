# rock-paper-scissors


A fully function game of rock-paper-scissors that you can play against the computer!

This project really challenged me to get to know Javascript very well. There was a lot of functionality now present that I couldn't even comprehend when I was getting started on this project. Starting bare-bones and building up from there to make it more pleasurable for the users was quite the hill to climb, but taking it step by step was really helpful in getting to a final product. 

Onto the next project!
